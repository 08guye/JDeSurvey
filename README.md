#### Many Question Types to Choose From

With an assortment of question types to choose from finding an appropriate one for particular questions is not a problem. Question types are separated into three categories: Standard, Matrix, and Other types. Standard question category includes the most commonly used types:

* Use a Yes/No drop down box to receive an answer from a participant that will either be a “Yes” or “No”.
* Short text input fields allow entries containing up to 50 characters.
* Select a long text input type for answers containing up to 150 characters.
* Huge text input provides a text area to enter up to 2000 characters.
* Integer input fields accepts integer values.
* Collect monetary values by using the currency input field.
* Decimal input allows for decimal values to be entered as answers.
* Use the date question type for date responses.
* The single choice drop down type allows a selection to be made from an available list of options.
* Choose multiple options from a list with multiple choice check boxes.
* The dataset type populates a list with options by importing a collection of data, such as a file containing the list of the months in a year.
* Single choice radio buttons displays a group of options where a single selection can be made.
* Use the star rating question type to collect the degree of satisfaction as an answer.
* Just as with star ratings use the smiley faces type to collect satisfactory ratings.

Matrix question types are fundamentally identical to standard questions but may contain multiple elements where each one is defined by a row and column:

* Most of the standard questions are integrated as matrix types.
* Use matrix types for questions requiring a more diverse array of answers.

Other question types present the capability to add multimedia to questions along with receiving files from participants.

* By providing a link to images and videos they will be displayed to participants in conjunction with the question text.
* Allow a file upload option to give participants the ability to submit files as a response, such as Word or PDF documents.

### Analysis

### Advanced Features
#### Questions and Answers Logic

The logic features supported by JD eSurvey provides many advantages to individuals administering surveys as they allow them to have more control and flexibility on the flow of surveys. Participants also benefit from taking surveys with logic features as they provide a more user-friendly experience. Use the powerful branching logic feature to transport survey participants to different areas in a survey.

* Determine the conditions to be met in order to branch to different pages.
* Participants can be directed to specific pages depending on their answer entries allowing for irrelevant questions to be skipped.
* Apply branching logic to most of the question types, including numerical, date, currency inputs, and all of the option selection questions.

With the randomization feature you do not have to worry about survey participants memorizing surveys. By using this feature your concern for collecting inaccurate survey data is eliminated.

* Determine whether participants are cheating or not taking surveys seriously by randomizing the order of pages and questions.

1. Log in to the external site.
2. Locate the survey to be filled and click on the Fill Survey link.
3. If the survey is being filled out for the first time then a new survey will automatically be generated. Otherwise, click on the Create New Survey link located on the bottom right corner of the page.

5. Review the survey on the final page and click on Submit to finish.

#### How do I change the theme or color of surveys?

The color and overall look of surveys may be modified by selecting a different theme in the Create new Survey or Update Survey windows. Clicking on the Lookup Theme link located at the right of the theme options will display a preview of each theme.

### Data Collection

#### How do I download copies of completed surveys?

Survey entries may be downloaded as PDF files for viewing, printing, and keeping copies of them. To download survey entries do the following:

1. Go to Survey Entries at the top menu bar and click on List.
2. Select a survey and click on Show Entries.

1. Under Survey Entries click on the Export link.
2. Locate the survey that is to be exported from the list.
3. Choose a format to export the survey as by clicking on one of the links under the Actions column.
4. Specify a directory and file name and click on Save.

### Security

####How do I create users?

The process of creating both internal and external users may only be accomplished by administrators. To create new internal users follow these steps:

1. Ensure you are logged in as an administrator.
2. From the top menu bar go to the Security tab and click on Internal Users.
3. Click on Add new Internal User from the left panel.
4. On the Create new User page, click on the Enabled option to activate the account or leave it blank if the account is to remain deactivated.
5. Fill in the rest of the required fields.
	*Note: The date of birth field accepts inputs in the MM/dd/yyyy format. The password must be at least eight characters long, contain at least one number, one lower case letter, one upper case letter, and at least one of these special characters: [@#$%^&+=]*
6. Select a group to place the user under.
7. If the assigned group is Survey Administrators, then choose a department or departments the user will have access to.

The method of creating a new external user is essentially identical, except that the only option under the Groups section is Survey Participants. Also, instead of having departmental access external users only have access to surveys.

#### Where is the option to make surveys private or public to participants?

The option to make a survey private or public is located in the Create new Survey and Update Survey windows. The checkbox is labeled as Available to public. By default the option is left unchecked so that participants will be required to log in with appropriate credentials to access the survey.

#### When I try to log in I am getting a message that states "Your login attempt was not successful, try again. Reason: User is disabled." Why is this occurring?

This message is displayed when a user attempts to sign into the application with an inactive account. An administrator can remedy this issue by:

3. Find the disabled account and click on the Update User link under the Actions column.
4. Check the Enbaled checkbox and click on Save.

### Logic Features

#### What do the randomize questions and options features do?

The randomize feature sorts a list of questions and answers in a randomized order. This allows for a survey to display questions and options in a different order each time. The randomization feature is found in the create/update survey page window and in the create/update questions window.

#### How do I apply branching logic to surveys?

Branching is a method for skipping irrelevant questions based upon answer entries. While filling out surveys, there may be instances where particular answers require a participant to skip to specific questions or sections within the survey. To add branching logic to questions follow these steps:

1. Choose a survey page containing the questions to add the branching logic.
2. Click on the Edit branch and skip logic icon located inside the page header.
3. Select the page to skip to in the Go To drop down list.
4. In the When section choose a condition to be applied.
5. Enable the questions to apply the logic to.
6. Under the Values section, pick the answers that will activate the branch.
7. Click on Save.

#### What is the piping of answers feature and how do I use it?

The piping feature allows selected answers from questions to be incorporated into other questions. To utilize the piping functionality a parameter must be added to the question text. The parameter consists of a dollar sign, opening curly brace, page number, question number, and closing curly brace, written in that order. So for example, if we want to use te answer from question 4 on page 2, we would add the following parameter inside the current question text: ${p2q4}.

*Note: The piping feature is only operational by referencing answers from preceding pages. Attempting to use an answer from a future page will not work.*

Only administrators are allowed to add, update, and delete masks. Applying them to questions may be carried out during the question creation or update processes under the Validation Information section.
